# CS210-Project

A data analysis project featuring in-depth analysis of datasets from TURKSTAT along with use of various machine learning models

Contents:

- CS210_Project.ipnyb: A Jupyter notebook file containing data analysis, data visualization and machine learning models. All code is contained here

- CPI.csv: A csv file for average consumer price index (CPI) in Turkey between the years 2014-2021

- IncomeMeanCSV.csv: A csv file containing the mean income in Turkey split among decile groups for different regions, between the years 2014-2021.

- IncomeMediaCSV.csv: A csv file containing the median income in Turkey split among decile groups for different regions, between the years 2014-2021.

Details:

- Data acquired from TÜİK/TURKSTAT

- Uses pandas to store data and perform basic data sanity checks

- Uses matplotlib to visualize and analyze data

- Uses 4 different supervized machine learning models to predict mean income: Linear regression, polynomial regression, decision tree regressor and random forest.
